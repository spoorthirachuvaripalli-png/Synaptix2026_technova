PROBLEM STATEMENT:
develop an adaptive online assessment platform that dynamically adjusts question difficulty in real time based on student responses and performance patterns. the system should generate a personalized competency profile at the end of the assessment,highlighting strenghts,weakness,and mastery levels across topics.     

OVERVIEW OF OUR PROJECT:
Our project, Online Quiz and Performance Analysis System, is a web-based application designed to modernize the traditional examination process. In many educational institutions, assessments are manual, time-consuming, and lack instant feedback. Students often wait long periods to know their performance, and there is no proper subject-wise analysis or ranking system.

To solve this problem, we developed a smart quiz platform that provides instant evaluation, subject-wise performance analysis, graphical representation using charts, and a real-time leaderboard ranking system. The system automatically checks answers, calculates scores, and visually presents performance in an easy-to-understand format.

This project improves efficiency, saves time, and enhances the learning experience through technology.
